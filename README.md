# üí¨ Chatbot Flow Builder

This project was developed as part of the BiteSpeed Frontend Task. The goal was to build a lightweight and modular chatbot flow builder using **React** and **React Flow**. Users can visually create chatbot workflows by dragging and connecting message nodes. I‚Äôve also added basic **responsive design** so it functions well on mobile devices.

**Tech Stack:** ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, React Flow, React Icons, React Toastify, React Hooks
